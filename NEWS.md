# neurogam 0.0.1

* Pushing the first version of `neurogam`.

# neurogam 0.0.2

* Improved plotting: now plotting the GAM-smoothed signal and improved clusters aesthetics.
* Allowing 3 different models to be fitted: full GAMM, GAMM with summary statistics, or group-level GAM.
* Adding further support for presence or absence of predictor (e.g., group, condition). When predictor_id=NA, neurogam now tests signal against 0 through time.
