# Modelling time-resolved electrophysiological data with Bayesian generalised additive multilevel models <a href="https://lnalborczyk.github.io/neurogam/"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="139" alt="neurogam website" /></a>

The goal of `neurogam` is to provide utilities for estimating the onset and offset of time-resolved effects, such as those found in M/EEG, pupillometry, or finger/mouse-tracking data (amongst others). The current version only allows fitting 1D temporal data (e.g., raw M/EEG data or decoding timecourses) but will be extended in the near future to support 2D temporal or spatiotemporal data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `neurogam` from GitHub with:

```{r packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github(
    repo = "https://github.com/lnalborczyk/neurogam",
    dependencies = TRUE
    )
```

## Usage

### Model fitting

Below we fit a Bayesian generalised additive multilevel model (BGAMM) to estimate the onset and offset of a difference between conditions (in simulated EEG data). Note that we recommend fitting the BGAMM on time-resolved summary statistics (mean and SD) as the full (i.e., trial-by-trial) BGAMM may be too slow, and the group-level BGAM (i.e., no random/varying effect) may provide too liberal cluster estimates.

```{r data}
# loading the neurogam package
library(neurogam)

# importing some simulated EEG data
data(eeg_data)

# displaying some rows
head(eeg_data)
```

```{r clusters, results = "hide"}
# fitting the BGAMM to identify clusters
results <- testing_through_time(
    # simulated EEG data
    data = eeg_data,
    # name of predictor in data
    # predictor_id = "condition",
    # when predictor_id = NA, tests average level against 0
    predictor_id = NA,
    # we recommend fitting the GAMM with summary statistics (mean and SD)
    multilevel = "summary",
    # threshold on posterior odds
    threshold = 10
    )
```

### Visualising the results

```{r print-clusters}
# displaying the identified clusters
print(results)
```

```{r fig-clusters, fig.asp = 0.5, dev = "png", dpi = 300}
# plotting the data, model's predictions, and clusters
plot(results)
```

### Posterior predictive checks

We recommend visually assessing the predictions of the model against the observed data.

```{r fig-ppc, fig.asp = 0.5, fig.width = 12, dev = "png", dpi = 300}
# posterior predictive checks (PPCs)
ppc(results)
```

### How to define the basis dimension?

There is no universal recommendation for choosing the optimal value of $k$, as it depends on several factors, including the sampling rate, preprocessing steps (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio, low-pass filtering), and the underlying temporal dynamics of the effect of interest. One strategy is to set $k$ as high as computational constraints allow (acknowledging that the $k$-value only provides an upper bound on the *effective* basis dimension). Alternatively, one can fit a series of models with different $k$ values and compare these models using information criteria such as LOOIC or WAIC, alongside with posterior predictive checks (PPCs), to select the model that best captures the structure of the data. We illustrate this approach below.

```{r fig-reco-k, fig.asp = 0.5, dev = "png", dpi = 300, results = "hide"}
# recommend an optimal smooth basis dimension k
k_res <- recommend_k(
    object = results,
    k_min = 10,
    k_max = 40,
    k_step = 5,
    criterion = "waic"
    )
```

```{r fig-reco-k_summary}
# results summary
summary(k_res)
```
